# Simple Compiler



#### In this project we aim to make a simple compiler following these steps :


- At first we should declare the grammer of our language, you can find the declaration in [CLike.g4](https://github.com/ReyhanehAhani/Compiler_Design_Course_Project/blob/main/CLike.g4) and then we should make a lexer and parser.
- In the next step we have to consider that this grammer has some ambiguous rules so we should fix them and then we write a function, named ExpressiontoStack to handle arithmatics expressions, boolean expressions and unary expressions also we handle making symbol table and identifiers/blocks declaration.
- And finaly we write a structure to handle functions and their activation recordes.

###### Take look at [run.md](https://github.com/ReyhanehAhani/Compiler_Design_Course_Project/blob/main/run.md) file for running program and visualising parse tree (generated by ANTLR)
